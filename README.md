# Gitlet

* Miniature version of git
* Created from scratch, written in Java
* Allows you to create a gitlet repository anywhere on your computer, much like with git
* Commands I implemented include add, commit, merge, branch, reset, find, log, rm, rmbranch, and globallog
* Uses serialization to store information in a hidden folder in each gitlet repository
